## Raise an Issue

Is something missing?
Is something confusing?
Is something wrong?

[See if your issue has already been reported](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lycheeverse.github.io/issues), and if not, [create a new one](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lycheeverse.github.io/issues/new/choose).

## Make a Fix or Contribution

Did you find a typo, a broken link, or another item with an obvious quick fix?

If you can see what the problem is, and you know how to fix it, then you can make a PR (pull request) with the change and contribute to the docs repo yourself.
